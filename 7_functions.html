<!-- Functions in JavaScript -->
<!-- 
In this tutorial, we are going to learn about the JavaScript functions and why should we use them in JavaScript. A JavaScript function is a block of code designed to perform a particular task. 
They are one of the building blocks in JavaScript.

In this tutorial, we will create a new JavaScript file and attach it in the <script> tag as follows-

<script src= “tut53.js”></script>
To check whether our js file is attached or not, we can write 

console.log("This is tutorial 53");  


Let us now see how JavaScript functions help us. Assume that we have to repeatedly write the particular code for a certain task as shown below-

let name = "Harry";
let name1 = "Shubham";
let name2 = "Rohan";
let name3 = "Sagar";
console.log(name + “is a good boy”);
console.log(name1 + “is a good boy”);
console.log(name2 + “is a good boy”);
console.log(name3 + “is a good boy”);
As we can see in the above example, we are writing a particular set of codes every time. To avoid this JavaScript functions come into action. We can write the above code with the help of JavaScript functions as follows-



function greet(name){
          console.log(name + " is a good boy");
}
let name = "Harry";
let name1 = "Shubham";
let name2 = "Rohan";
let name3 = "Sagar";
greet(name);
greet(name1);
greet(name2);
greet(name3);
