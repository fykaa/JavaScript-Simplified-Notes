<!-- Navigation the DOM -->
<!-- 
In this tutorial, we are going to learn how we can do DOM manipulation in JavaScript.

    The HTML DOM (Document Object Model) is a standard object model and programming interface for HTML
    It defines:
    
    The HTML elements as objects
    The properties of all HTML elements
    The methods to access all HTML elements
    The events for all HTML elements
    In other words: The HTML DOM is a standard for how to get, change, add, or delete HTML elements.
    
    Let us begin with our HTML code as follows- 

The most common way to access an HTML element is to use the id of the element. For example, if we write as follows-
let main = document.getElementById('main');
console.log(main);

By writing getElementById, we can target the HTML through its id. Therefore, the result of the above code will look like-

Let us see another example. I want to target the elements under the id nav, we can write this as follows-

let nav = document.getElementById('nav');
console.log(nav);

For DOM to work, keep in mind that while selecting the elements with its id, there should be a unique id for every element in the HTML code. You cannot work with two same ids for different elements otherwise it will create a problem.

The easiest way to get the content of an element is by using the innerHTML property. It is useful for getting or replacing the content of HTML elements. 

However, we can also extract the elements from HTML with the help of class name. If we want to find all the elements with same class name, use getElementsByClassName(). Let us understand this with an example. If we write as follows-
let containers = document.getElementsByClassName('container');
console.log(containers);
The output of the above code will be as follows-

Here, we can see two container class as have made two container classes. But if we write as container(0) or container(1) then we will get the first and second containers respectively. 

If you want to find all HTML elements that match a specified CSS selector (id, class names, types, attributes, values of attributes, etc), use the querySelector()  method. For example, if we write-

let sel = document.querySelector('containerâ€™);
console.log("Selector returns ", sel)

We can use all the selectors that we have learned till now. 

We can also use querySelectorAll() to target the elements. For example, if we want to select all the ids, we can write as follows-
let sel = document.querySelectorAll('#nav');
console.log("Selector returns ", sel)
