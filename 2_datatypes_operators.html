<!-- Data Types and Operators in JavaScript -->
<!--
From the last tutorials, we are discussing JavaScript in detail. Moving on, here we will see what are variables in JavaScript and how to create them. 
The JavaScript variables are the containers for storing data values.
To understand it, initially, we have to add some HTML code to get started as follows-

As discussed earlier, variables are the data that stores value. Therefore, in the below example a and b are the variables that store integer and String values respectively.

var a = 78;
var b = "Harry";

To see the output, we have to write-

console.log(a);
console.log(b);

The result of both the variables will be displayed in the console tab of the browser. These types of variables are known as dynamic typing as you do not require to identify the data type.

If you are a web developer do not deep dive into the knowledge of core programming concepts because it can divert you from becoming a successful web developer. Therefore, it is recommended initially, do not get in the concepts of Data Structures or OOPS. Once you get the basic command over the JavaScript then you can move further.

Let us now understand the operators in JavaScript. There are two types of operators present in JavaScript- Binary Operators and Unary Operators. 

Unary Operators work only on 1 operand. For example, 3+4. On the other hand, 
Binary operators work only on 2 operands. For example, x= x+6. Here ‘=’ and ‘+’ are two operands.

Let us now understand different types of operators with the help of examples-

        var a = 78;
        var b = "Harry";
        c = 34.55;
        
        console.log(c);
        
        var num1 = 2;
        var num2 = 9;

        // Operators in JavaScript
        // Operand - entities on which operators operate
        // In 3 + 4 '+' is the operator and 3,4 are operands

        // 1. unary operator - It has single operand (x = -x)
        // Examples of unary operator
        c = -c;
        console.log(c);

        // 2. binary operator - It has two operand (x = x+6)
        // Examples of binary operator
        c = 456+8;
        console.log(c);


        // Arithmetic operators in action in JavaScript
        console.log("The value of num1 + num2 is "+ (num1 + num2));
        console.log("The value of num1 - num2 is "+ (num1 - num2));
        console.log("The value of num1 * num2 is "+ (num1 * num2));
        console.log("The value of num2 / num1 is "+ (num2 / num1));
        console.log("The value of num1 to power num2 is "+ (num1 ** num2));
        console.log("The value of num1++ is "+ (num1++));
        console.log("The value of ++num2 is "+ (++num2));
        console.log("The value of num1-- is "+ (num1--));
        console.log("The value of --num1 is "+ (--num1));
