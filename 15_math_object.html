<!-- JavaScript Tutorial- Math Object in JavaScript
In this tutorial, we are going to see different Math objects used in JavaScript. These are important for them who want to use different mathematical functions in their browser. This function allows us to perform mathematical tasks on numbers.

Make a new file as tut61.html and add the boilerplate to get the HTML template. Then give the title as Math Object under the <title> tag. If we write the following code under the <script> tag, then we will get the list of all those Math functions that are used in JavaScript.

let m = Math;
    console.log(m)
Let us now print the values of some constants using the Math functions. -->
